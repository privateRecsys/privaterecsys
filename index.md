# Welcome to Private Recsys

The PrivacyRecSys project aims to develop an open-source toolkit for delivering accurate recommendations while respecting users' privacy. The toolkit will include ranking and recommendation mechanisms that can assist privacy-focused open source search engines like Searx in producing better recommendations.

# Tasks


## Task 1: Project Setup 
The first task is focused on undertaking an analysis of Searx which will be used to produce the system architecture
document including components analysis. The produced documents will facilitate both the development of the system and its further integration into Searx. 
The [D1.System Architecture](https://github.com/privateRecsys/privaterecsys/blob/gh-pages/Documentation/D1.%20System%20Architecture_%20v1-1.pdf) is made available and will be updated with the updated system architecture, components analysis and sequence diagram by the end of the project.
