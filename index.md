## Welcome to Private Recsys

The PrivacyRecSys project aims to develop an open-source toolkit for delivering accurate recommendations while respecting users' privacy. The toolkit will include ranking and recommendation mechanisms that can assist privacy-focused open source search engines like Searx in producing better recommendations.
