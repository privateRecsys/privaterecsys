### Hi there üëã

By using any service online, or just by interacting in the Internet you produce data, which you may not realise at the beginning but putting them together can reveal sensitive and private information regarding you and your interests, your thoughts, your intentions. (e.g. movie ratings, medical records, e-mail patterns). 
These data can be useful for improving your online experience, for making sure that you find relevant articles to read, and helpful sources of information but also finding the products you want to buy and visiting the restaurants that match your taste.

There is a need for a way to have an intellligent and efficient internet, while at the same time protect your identity and have your privacy in mind.
Anonymisation techniques, have been used as a method of preserving real identities.. however, research has shown that deanonymization can easily be achived by combining multple sources of information.

Differential privacy aims to provide means to maximize the accuracy of these statistical queries while minimizing the chances of identifying its records. It introduces noise to real data so that, adding or removing one user to database does not make noticeable difference in the data, thus preventing to identify his/her private information. It is a probabilistic concept, therefore, any differentially private mechanism is necessarily randomized with Laplace mechanism, exponential mechanism etc.

Let Œµ be a positive real number and A be a randomized algorithm that takes a dataset as input (representing the actions of the trusted party holding the data). The algorithm A is Œµ-differentially private if for all datasets ùê∑_1 and ùê∑_2 that differ on a single element (i.e., the data of one person), and all subsets S of image of A.

where the probability is taken over the randomness used by the algorithm.

Differential privacy is used in this implementation of recommender systems.
